					c3bottles is a bottle drop and collection management system for
					chaos events. Collecting all the empty bottles is a hard task
					at every event since they appear in large numbers at places and
					times you cannot always plan beforehand. Bottle collectors need
					to roam the area all the time and check it periodically for any
					left empty bottles.
				</p>
				<p>
					To make this job a lot easier, bottle drop points were invented:
					Empty crates are placed at spots in the area where a high level
					of empty bottles is expected, e.g. exits of lecture halls,
					lounges or the main exit/entrance of a building. The visitors
					are advised to leave their bottles not at random but rather
					only at the designated bottle drop points. The bottle collectors
					then only need to visit these points to do their job.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, there are some caveats: In a large building like the
					CCH nobody is able to memorize all the drop points and some of
					them may be forgotten and overflow without anyone noticing. In
					addition, if the planning in advance was not perfect (as always),
					some drop points in popular locations may overflow very quickly
					making the job of the collectors a lot harder. At an overflowing
					drop point, they can't simply exchange a full crate for an empty
					one but instead have to put all the bottles laying on and around
					the more than full crate into their fresh one. In the worst case
					they then have lots of full but no empty crates left in
					locations with a high bottle drop rate. If that ever happens,
					the bottlecalypse is inevitable.
				</p>
				<p>
					c3bottles aims to solve this problem using modern web technology
					combined with crowdsourcing: A database tracks the state of all
					the drop points and visitors noticing full or overflowing drop
					points can report that fact. The bottle collectors will be
					notified and can react promptly. They track their tour and the
					system can notify them of drop points not visited in a long time
					or needing immediate action. Statistical analysis allows for
					continuous optimization of drop point placement by scaling drop
					points according to the demand or abandoning drop points in
					remote locations which are not used much anyway.

				<p>
					During placement of bottle drop points, every drop point is
					registered in the database with its number, position and capacity
					(i.e. number of empty crates). It gets a label telling the
					visitors to report full drop points using a URL specific for
					every drop point. On the website, the visitor can report the drop
					point as needing attention by simply clicking a button.
					Optionally, the visitor may inform the bottle collectors about
					the filling level of the drop point.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other end of the web interface shows a list of drop points to
					visit ordered by priority: Drop points reported a lot lately get
					a high priority which is even higher if the respective drop point
					has a high capacity and/or was just emptied and is filling up
					again quickly. Drop points not visited for a long time get a high
					priority too, so the collectors can check their current state.
				</p>
				<p>
					A map shows the location of all the drop points so new members of
					the bottle collector team can find them easily and visitors can
					always find the nearest drop point to their current location.
				</p>
				<p>
					The bottle collectors track their actions when visiting drop
					points by clicking a button whenever they empty a drop point.
					In addition, they can change the location or capacity of drop
					points if needed.

					Great! Helping is easy: If you spot a bottle drop point that seems
					to need attention, just visit the URL printed on the sign posted
					there. You are presented with a website with a few buttons. Just
					click on the one you think fits most. Congratulations! :)
				</p>
				<p>
					Please do not abuse the system like reporting the same drop point
					multiple times since it can only work as good as its input is. If
					you accidentally pressed the wrong button and e.g. reported an
					overflowing drop point as empty, don't hesitate to report it again
					with the correct state. The system will react to this accordingly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any report of a drop point is helpful, even if it is not overflowing.
					Reports of empty or only sparsely used drop points help the bottle
					collectors prioritize their visits, plan their tours optimally and
					rearrange crates or moving drop points as they see fit. The
					optimization works better the more detailed the reporting is.
					Last but not least, the statistics gets more impressive with
					larger numbers.

				<p>
					The bottle collectors are volunteers and help is always appreciated.
					More hands collect and sort more bottles more quickly. If this is a
					congress and you already are an angel, just search and register for
					bottle collection shifts in the angel system. If this is a congress
					and you are no angel yet, ask for heaven, go there and tell the
					friendly people there want to help.
				</p>
				<p>
					If this is any other event in the chaos family, it should work
					similarly to congress but the names heaven and angels might differ.
					Just ask some people who look like they could know what's up. In
					doubt, just report your nearest drop point and wait for the
					collector team to	show up. They should know what they're doing.

					I started this project because I finally wanted to get my head around
					modern web development techniques. It is written in Python using the
					Flask	web framework. The database is accessed using SQLAlchemy and
					the	backend of choice is PostgreSQL. If you are (or want to	become)
					familiar with all that stuff and feel comfortable with the
					choices made,	you are invited to contribute.

					The link in the footer of this page will lead you to the GitHub
